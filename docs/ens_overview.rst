Ethereum Name Service
================================

The Ethereum Name Service is analogous to the Domain Name Service. It
enables users and developers to refer to names in place of addresses, content hashes, and more.

The ``ens`` module is included with web3.py. It provides an interface to look up
an address from a name, buy a name from the '.eth' Registrar auction,
set up your own address, and more.

.. warning::
  Your funds are your responsibility.  

  If you are registering a name, a small misunderstanding can cause you to lose
  **all** of your deposit. You must `understand ENS auctions
  <http://docs.ens.domains/en/latest/userguide.html#registering-a-name-with-the-auction-registrar>`_
  independent of this library. 

Setup
-----

Create an :class:`ens.ENS` object (named ``ns`` below) in one of three ways:

1. Automatic detection
2. Specify an instance or list of :ref:`providers`
3. Reuse an existing :class:`web3.Web3` object

::

    # automatic detection
    from ens.auto import ns


    # or, with a provider
    from web3 import IPCProvider
    from ens import ENS

    provider = IPCProvider(...)
    ns = ENS(provider)


    # or, with a w3 instance
    from ens import ENS

    w3 = Web3(...)
    ns = ENS.fromWeb3(w3)


Usage
-----

Name info
~~~~~~~~~

.. _ens_get_address:

Look up the address for an ENS name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    from ens.auto import ns


    # look up the hex representation of the address for a name

    eth_address = ns.address('jasoncarver.eth')

    assert eth_address == '0x5B2063246F2191f18F2675ceDB8b28102e957458'


    # ens.py will assume you want a .eth name if you don't specify a full name

    assert ns.address('jasoncarver') == eth_address


Get name from address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    domain = ns.name('0x5B2063246F2191f18F2675ceDB8b28102e957458')


    # name() also accepts the bytes version of the address

    assert ns.name(b'[ c$o!\x91\xf1\x8f&u\xce\xdb\x8b(\x10.\x95tX') == domain


    # confirm that the name resolves back to the address that you looked up:

    assert ns.address(domain) == '0x5B2063246F2191f18F2675ceDB8b28102e957458'

Get owner of name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    eth_address = ns.owner('exchange.eth')

Set up your name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Point your name to your address
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do you want to set up your name so that ``ens.address()`` will show the
address it points to?

::

    ns.setup_address('jasoncarver.eth', '0x5B2063246F2191f18F2675ceDB8b28102e957458')

You must already be the owner of the domain (or its parent).

In the common case where you want to point the name to the owning
address, you can skip the address

::

    ns.setup_address('jasoncarver.eth')

You can claim arbitrarily deep subdomains. *Gas costs scale up with the
number of subdomains!*

::

    ns.setup_address('supreme.executive.power.derives.from.a.mandate.from.the.masses.jasoncarver.eth')

Wait for the transaction to be mined, then:

::

    assert ns.address('supreme.executive.power.derives.from.a.mandate.from.the.masses.jasoncarver.eth') == \
        '0x5B2063246F2191f18F2675ceDB8b28102e957458'

Point your address to your name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do you want to set up your address so that ``ens.name()`` will show the
name that points to it?

This is like Caller ID. It enables you and others to take an account and
determine what name points to it. Sometimes this is referred to as
"reverse" resolution.

::

    ns.setup_name('jasoncarver.eth', '0x5B2063246F2191f18F2675ceDB8b28102e957458')

If you don't supply the address, ``setup_name`` will assume you want the
address returned by ``ens.address(name)``.

::

    ns.setup_name('jasoncarver.eth')

If the name doesn't already point to an address, ``ens.setup_name`` will
call ``ens.setup_address`` for you.

Wait for the transaction to be mined, then:

::

    assert ns.name('0x5B2063246F2191f18F2675ceDB8b28102e957458') == 'jasoncarver.eth'

Auctions for names ending in .eth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get auction status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Example with domain 'payment.eth':

::

    from ens.registrar import Status


    status = ns.registrar.status('payment')


    # if you forget to strip out .eth, ens.py will do it for you

    assert ns.registrar.status('payment.eth') == status


    # these are the possible statuses

    assert status in (
      Status.Open,
      Status.Auctioning,
      Status.Owned,
      Status.Forbidden,
      Status.Revealing,
      Status.NotYetAvailable
      )


    # if you get the integer status from another source, you can compare it directly

    assert Status.Owned == 2

Start auctions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    # start one auction (which tips people off that you're interested)

    ns.registrar.start('you_saw_him_repressin_me_didnt_ya')


    # start many auctions (which provides a bit of cover)

    ns.registrar.start(['exchange', 'tickets', 'payment', 'trading', 'registry'])

Bid on auction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bid on a 'trading.eth' with 5211 ETH, and secret "I promise I will not
forget my secret":

::

    from web3utils import web3

    ns.registrar.bid(
          'trading',
          web3.toWei('5211', 'ether'),
          "I promise I will not forget my secret",
          transact={'from': web3.eth.accounts[0]}
          )

(if you want to "mask" your bid, set a higher value in the transact
dict)

Reveal your bid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You must **always** reveal your bid, whether you won or lost. Otherwise
you will lose the full deposit.

Example of revealing your bid on 'registry.eth' with 0.01 ETH, and
secret "For real, though: losing your secret means losing ether":

::

    ns.registrar.reveal(
          'registry',
          web3.toWei('0.01', 'ether'),
          "For real, though: losing your secret means losing ether",
          transact={'from': web3.eth.accounts[0]}
          )

Claim the name you won
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

aka "Finalize" auction, which makes you the owner in ENS.

::

    ns.registrar.finalize('gambling')

Get detailed information on an auction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Find out the owner of the auction Deed -- see `docs on the
difference <http://docs.ens.domains/en/latest/userguide.html#managing-ownership>`__
between owning the name and the deed

::

    deed = ns.registrar.deed('ethfinex')

    assert deed.owner() == '0x5B2063246F2191f18F2675ceDB8b28102e957458'

When was the auction completed? (a timezone-aware datetime object)

::

    close_datetime = ns.registrar.close_at('ethfinex')

    assert str(close_datetime) == '2017-06-05 08:10:03+00:00'

How much is held on deposit?

::

    from decimal import Decimal

    deposit = ns.registrar.deposit('ethfinex')

    assert web3.fromWei(deposit, 'ether') == Decimal('0.01')

What was the highest bid?

::

    top_bid = ns.registrar.top_bid('ethfinex')

    assert web3.fromWei(top_bid, 'ether') == Decimal('201709.02')
