If a transaction hash was passed as a string rather than a HexByte to ``w3.eth.wait_for_transaction_receipt``, and the time was exhausted before the transaction is in the chain, the error being raised was a TypeError instead of the correct TimeExhausted error. This is because the ``to_hex`` method in the TimeExhausted error message expects a primitive as the first argument, and a string doesn't qualify as a primitive. Fixed by converting the transaction_hash to HexBytes instead.
